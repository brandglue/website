<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it’s fun to remember the good ‘ole days of Facebook, when you’d push out an organic post for a brand and it’d garner 100 likes in an hour. While this still definitely happens, it is no longer the norm like it was ten years ago. Today, it’s a pay to play game, and being a Facebook ads expert is a must-have for social media marketers. In this blog I’m going to dig into Facebook dynamic ads &#8212; what they are, how to set them up, and how to optimize them for your brand. Let’s dig in!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic ads, unlike static ads, are highly personalized. They have a much higher conversion rate than most other ads because the content changes with time and consumer behavior. Dynamic ads are also more likely to get people to visit and buy from your website repeatedly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can you get the most out of these ads? I’ve put together a list of four ways you can optimize Facebook dynamic ads for your brand:</span>

## **1. Creative testing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any social media initiative, there’s no way to fully know how your audience will react to your post until you try it out. By utilizing A/B testing in your Facebook ads, you can quickly learn what resonates the most with your target audience, and optimize accordingly. With dynamic ads, you have the ability to test as many ad components as you’d like. Some of your options include:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad types</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Images</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad copy</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls-to-action</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Audiences</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers/incentives</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you test, the more you’ll know &#8212; and the better the results you will see from future dynamic ads.</span>

## **2. Image templates**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world where mindless, endless scrolling is the norm, you have to really (and I mean really!) make sure your ad images will stand out from the crowd. More specifically, ad images need to spark the interest of your target audience. A great place to start (as mentioned above) is by using </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve learned what entices your audience, start working with image templates that will allow you to establish a look and feel that lets your target know the ad is yours before they even start to read the copy. This is a great way to further the overall branding of your business, as well as get folks to quickly see and act upon the CTA of the ad.</span>

## **3. Control ad frequency**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is very important &#8212; be careful with the frequency on your dynamic ads. Setting a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">narrow time window</span>][2] <span style="font-weight: 400;">can cause your dynamic ad’s reach to target too small of an audience. This will cause the frequency to be too high, meaning that the same small group of people will be seeing your ad over and over again. Not only will this cause your reach and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">engagement </span>][3]<span style="font-weight: 400;">to be extremely low, but can also lead to low CTRs, CPCs and relevance scores. Allowing an ad to run at too high a frequency can also cause members of the chosen audience to unfollow you due to the high exposure they’re receiving. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding more people into your targeting funnel and modifying your bid type will help you obtain better results. You can also try out Facebook’s Custom Combination option, which for folks in the ecommerce space, will allow you to separate add-to-cart viewers from product page viewers. </span>

## **4. Clearly define the CTA**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No CTA? Don’t be surprised when your ad’s engagement results are disappointing. You have to let users know what it is that you want from them. Without a CTA, it is unlikely that they will click on the ad. Facebook’s built-in buttons include:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Book Now</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact Us</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Use App</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Play Game</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Now</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign Up</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Video</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Give several a try in your next dynamic ad and watch the CTR rise. Learn from which CTA is the winner, and optimize future ads accordingly. You can also take these learnings and utilize them on other social platforms where you’re running ads, such as LinkedIn and Twitter.</span>

**While Facebook dynamic ad optimization is an ongoing process of trial and error, these 4 tips are a great way to ensure that you are on the path to success.**
