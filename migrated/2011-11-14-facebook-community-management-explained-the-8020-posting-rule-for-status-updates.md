If you&#8217;re a social media community manager, than you most likely have heard about the 80/20 rule. It&#8217;s a hard rule to follow, let alone get it right. Let me explain first what it is, then how to accomplish it.

Really, it&#8217;s quite simple. All of the content pushed out on your Facebook fan page should fall into roughly two categories:

**1. Content directly related to your brand and product and is self-promotional.**

**2. Content indirectly related to your brand and product and adds value to your fans, thus building loyalty.**

Let me explain a bit further. By **directly relates**, I&#8217;m referring to:

- Product pushes
- Coupons
- The latest news from your development team
- Ticket sales
- Holiday-related status updates that push your product

Here are some examples of what I call direct product pushes:

    The<strong> indirect content pushes</strong> are a bit different, mostly because it&#8217;s such a wide category. These could be anything from:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Current national or local events
    </li>
    <li>
      Holidays
    </li>
    <li>
      Funny pictures
    </li>
    <li>
      Pop culture
    </li>
    <li>
      Quotes
    </li>
  </ul>

    Let me give you some examples of indirect content pushes:

          For most marketers and social media community managers, it&#8217;s easy to get direct product pushes right. We&#8217;re good at that! It&#8217;s the indirect ones that get us. I can&#8217;t emphasize enough though how important they are. They should make up 80% of your content. Why? Because <strong>they are the status updates upon which you build your community.</strong> They bring the social into &#8220;social media&#8221;. Time and again they get the most comments, likes and shares. They drive engagement and help you relate to your fans, <a title="Burt's Bees" href="http://www.facebook.com/burtsbees" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">even if your product is beeswax. </a>

          So try it out! Tomorrow, post a status update on your fan page that is completely indirect. Have it be about the upcoming holidays, but don&#8217;t sell anything. See who&#8217;s traveling the farthest for Thanksgiving or who likes dark turkey meat over white. While some marketers think this is trival and not worthwhile (I know, because I&#8217;ve practically had to fight some people to get them to try this type of content), I can promise you that it will build your community and be some of the highest engagement posts yet.

          Don&#8217;t believe me? Try it for a week. Let the data speak for itself. Then respond in the comments with your findings.
