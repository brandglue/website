BrandGlueâ€™s designer, Joey Ponce, was recently crowned the champion of [Shutterstockâ€™s Pixels of Fury competition in Indianapolis][1]. Joey competed against five other talented designers in a live demonstration. Attendees watched live as the digital art came to life in front of their very eyes. While weâ€™re certain Joey faced some fierce and talented competition, the BrandGlue team was not surprised to hear he came out on top.

Since moving to Indianapolis in the summer of 2011, Joey has been focusing his energy on building up the vibrant and energetic design culture of his community. He has been producing amazing content for BrandGlueâ€™s clients for over a year and is an invaluable part of our team.

Congrats, Joey! We knew you&#8217;d knock it out of the park. Our thoughts are with those you will face in future design competitions. ðŸ™‚
