**Job Title:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic Design Lead</span>

**About BrandGlue**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a social media agency, reaching our clients’ audiences in the places they hang out most. The companies we work with would tell you that we pride ourselves on our “Nordstrom-level” customer service and that we know our stuff. Social media best practices change almost daily and we provide the peace-of-mind that we are reaching and growing each client’s audience on social media in the most effective ways possible. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At BrandGlue, we like to have fun, enjoy the people we work with, and love to see our clients win. We are known for getting work done quickly and efficiently and providing top-level industry knowledge about social media and current trends. Another unique aspect of BrandGlue’s company culture is that we do not have a physical office. The entire team works remotely from locations all over the country, including Seattle, Indianapolis, the Bay area and more. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of our unique structure, every team member has autonomy with their day-to-day schedule, which means we require each person to be self-motivated, driven and trustworthy to be given this privilege. For those who struggle with sticking to a timeline or cannot meet deadlines without being constantly reminded, this is not the job for you. We expect each team member to get their tasks done when they need to be done. As with everyone on the team, we expect the graphic designer to be able to answer calls throughout the day, keep the rest of the team updated on each project process, and respond to emails quickly during work hours.</span>

**Who We Are Looking For**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BrandGlue is seeking to hire a self-motivated and deadline-driven graphic designer who will both lead and shape the creative process for all client projects. As a small and nimble team, this position plays an integral role in the success of the company and the person who fills it must be highly motivated and able to work in a fast-paced agency environment. Missing deadlines is not an option as our clients rely on us to move quickly and be a reliable source of quality work. This designer should possess his/her own creative style and at minimum maintain up-to-date skills in design software, including Adobe Creative Suite.</span>

**Responsibilities** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The responsibilities of this role includes managing all creative projects, which primarily consist of social media graphics, infographics, application design, ebook/white paper layout design and animated videos for clients across a variety of B2B and B2C industries. For a list of some of the clients that we have worked with, please visit our website. This role will also be responsible for developing internal marketing pieces for BrandGlue’s website, email marketing, social media channels and other needs that may arise. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other skills that are crucial to the success of this position are possessing the ability to interface with clients with poise and professionalism and explain the strategy behind the designs we create. Strong communication skills are a must as well as having a high level of integrity for keeping his/herself on schedule for all meetings and deadlines. The graphic designer will have another team member as the main point-of-contact for each client and will be expected to support those individuals. This will include guiding the client on design brainstorms, getting approval of concepts, pitching new ideas, and communicating throughout the execution process. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of this type of work is that you will be consistently introduced to new brands and projects and have variety of different creative styles to work with. With that said, since we are a small team, we also require this position to be willing to adapt and fill in the gaps for other tasks as needed, which could include content curation, social media posting, data pulling and analysis, attending client calls, brainstorming and executing social campaigns, and any other needs that arise from our clients. Training for these additional skills will be provided. </span>
