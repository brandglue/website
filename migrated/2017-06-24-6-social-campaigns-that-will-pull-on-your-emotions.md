What makes an ad have the power to move someone to action? A great ad is able to go past the surface level of selling a &#8220;product&#8221; and hit the audience where they feel it most &#8212; the heart strings.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more companies are realizing the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits of having human-centered advertising strategies</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are seeing a strong presence of campaigns that evoke feeling and emotion, but are also careful not to shove their product in your face. They take the subtle approach of developing warm feelings first towards the brand and then </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">make the connection to the products on your own. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of these types of campaigns have been overwhelming. It results in </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">higher engagement, shares, and word of mouth</span>][2]<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pulled some of our favorite ad campaigns that evoke emotion to share with you as inspiration for your next campaign. Note how each one makes you feel &#8212; especially towards the brand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>**1. Coca-Cola &#8211; Small World Machines &#8211; Bringing India & Pakistan Together**

{{< youtube ts_4vOUDImE >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was one of the first examples I can remember seeing where the brand used their product to hit on people&#8217;s emotions. They identified an existing problem and created a solution that they could be tied to.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: Coca-Cola vending machine and free Coca-Cola bottles</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>**2. Valspar Paint &#8211; Color for the Colorblind**

{{< youtube ea_xOqNvntA >}}

Valspar really hit home with this one by focusing on what they do best: color. Naturally, when I watched this for the first as, I teared up. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: Product is seen as paint swatches painted on the wall. Prominent hashtag (#ColorForAll) followed by smaller logo underneath</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>

**3. Gillette &#8211; #‎GoAskDad‬**

{{< youtube fmWRODY0ing >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another tear-jerker, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schik</span>][3] <span style="font-weight: 400;">took advantage of the father-son relationship and proved that while we exist in a fast-paced technology-based lifestyle, human-to-human interaction still yields the best results. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: Actual product shown when Father and Son are shaving together</span>_

**4. Ad Council &#8211; Love Has No Labels**

{{< youtube PnDgZuGIhHs >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad Council</span>][4] <span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully launched a viral video and got 58 millions views. How did they do it? They chose a controversial topic and were able to find a common denominator between all races and genders. How could you not fall in love with this organization??</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: Subtle logo placement on the screen in the left hand corner</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.</span> **Dove &#8211; Real Beauty Sketches Campaign**

{{< youtube litXW91UauE >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dove did an excellent job taking the focus off of their sales and showcasing what they stand for as a company. They wanted to make women feel beautiful. They were able to take common insecurities and debunk them by showing each woman how their perception of themselves is not what other’s see.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: Logo at the end of the video</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. </span>**Always &#8211; #LikeAGirl**

{{< youtube XjJQBjWYDTs >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure you remember this one. This video quickly went viral, spreading across the Internet like wildfire. The entire campaign is focused on empowering women, especially at a young age. What better way to encourage and support the next generation of girls?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Placement: CTA followed by the logo at the end of the video</span>_

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching those, I don’t think I need to convince you that video has a powerful effect on any audience. Add on top of that, that in these examples the video is connecting to people &#8212; real humans &#8212; with what they value and care about in life. These brands are tying themselves to a greater cause outside of what they are selling. This ideas proves time and time again to be one of the best ways to build loyalty as a brand. </span>
