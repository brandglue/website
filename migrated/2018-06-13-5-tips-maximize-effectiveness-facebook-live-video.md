<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you recorded a Facebook Live video yet? If not, it’s time to join the trend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Live streaming is here to stay, and estimates suggest it will be a</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">\$70+ billion industry by 2021</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Beyond the financial growth, video has become an essential part of marketing strategy, with</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of businesses</span>][2] <span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing video in their marketing efforts as of December 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is obvious: people love watching videos. </span>**In fact,** **72% of people would chose video over text to learn about a product or service.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Video, especially if it’s live-streamed, is an</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">effective medium for reaching your audience</span>][3] <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a relatable, attention-grabbing way. But before you rush to your phone and start recording a FB Live on the spot, there are some considerations to make.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 5 tips to turn that next livestream into a winner.</span>

## **Tip 1: Advertise Beforehand**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t assume people will come or will even know you’re going to be Live. Let people know ahead of time. Facebook suggests at</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">least a day</span>][4] <span style="font-weight: 400;">of lead time. The more effort you put into promoting your upcoming broadcast, the more likely you’ll be able to draw people when you go Live.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another tip here is to ask viewers to subscribe to Live notifications. This is </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">key. </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Live videos and videos that were live have a “Follow” button. This is a great way to motivate you to record more than one video, and it will keep people coming back when you have something new to offer.</span>

## **Tip 2: Don’t Cut it Short**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our age of distractions, insistent notifications, and constantly evolving social media feeds, this tip seems out of place. The fact is, Facebook Live videos will garner more attention at longer durations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How long? Facebook recommends a</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum of 10 minutes</span>][4] <span style="font-weight: 400;">for your video. The reason is that even if you did due diligence and let people know about your Live video, you didn’t reach everyone— and you want to maximize the chances of people watching, right? Recording for a decent length of time will give people scrolling through their feeds a better chance of happening on your video.</span>

## **Tip 3: Be Personal and Friendly**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This plays out in a couple different ways.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Engage with your viewers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Greet them by name when they join, answer questions as they pop up in the comments, and generally be outgoing and enjoyable to watch. Even if your video is informational, you can still find ways to connect.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Don’t worry about getting it perfect.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is where the personal part comes in. Yes, there may be times when looking more cleaned up and professional is desirable, but don’t think it’s required. People want to form connections, to feel included. Accomplishing that could be as simple as recording at your local coffee shop to give people a glimpse into how you brainstorm business strategy.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The level to which you’re personal versus professional should align with your your brand’s tone. A video by a B2B tech company won’t have the same feel as one by a graphic artist entrepreneur. Ultimately, the goal is to connect, not give a hard sell.</span>

## **Tip 4: Consider Using a Tripod**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a requirement. Whether you choose to use a tripod depends on your needs and goals. A tripod will ensure a stable, professional shot, but part of the attraction of Live video is the natural feel it provides. So evaluate what you want to accomplish and plan accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re going to be walking around, say at a conference, a selfie stick or handheld tripod is a great option to provide stability.</span>

## **Tip 5: Invest in a Quality Mic**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While being personal and friendly is important, you don’t want to come across as an amateur. Do yourself—and your viewers—a favor and use a quality mic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Faint, garbled, or otherwise difficult to hear sound quality won’t cut it. In other words, if your audio leaves you audience feeling like it’s hearing Algebra 2 taught in the middle of a thunderstorm over a spotty radio connection, it’s time for an upgrade. There are plenty of good mics out there that don’t to cost an arm and a leg, wired and wireless, depending on your needs. Better to fork out some money and produce videos you can be proud of.</span>

## **Bonus tip: Choose an Optimal Time**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t fall into the notion that, “If I record, they will come.” That may be true to some extent; however, certain times of day are better suited to tapping that red “Go Live” button. If possible, you should aim for going live between 1-3pm and 6-9pm. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With these tips in hand, you’re on your way to creating effective, engaging Facebook Live videos that people will love.</span>
