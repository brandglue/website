Facebook can be a lonely place for many B2B companies, but it doesn’t have to be. We’ll show you how.

Actionable lessons learned by the BrandGlue and Eloqua Facebook collaboration, which resulted in a 2,500% growth in Eloqua’s Facebook fan community, 150% growth in Facebook referred traffic and nearly 300% greater fan engagement than industry norms.

### Start by Stopping

If you are doing these things, don’t:

- Declarative status updates.
- Text-only status updates.
- Inconsistent posts.
- Repetitive topics.
- Back-to-back frequency.
- Ignoring referral traffic.
- Know Where Your Fans Come From

Find “bright spots” in your fan acquisition strategy, and scale those successes. Where is the growth coming from?

- Sweepstakes: 1,079 — 43%
- Paid Advertising: 872 — 35%
- Organic: 336 — 13%
- Like Boxes/Widgets: 211 — 8%
- Search/Request: 12 — 1%

### How to Deconstruct the Daunting “Other” Wedge

- Identify spikes in growth
- Annotate dates of spikes (contest, PR, ads)
- Categorize the amount of growth during the spikes
- Subtract the spike categories, social widgets, and search/requests, to see yoru organic growth.

### Create a Landing Tab

Single call-to-action “like” increases conversions A/B test on Mint.com’s Facebook page revealed a 73% increase in conversions with a landing tab.

### Engagement = Passive. Acquisition = Active.

Fans engage with your content passively via the newsfeed, but you acquire them via direction action (they search for you).

Internal referral source:

- Number of referrals via search: 1,150, or 92%.
- Number of referrals via the stream: 97, or 8%.

### Sweepstakes Attract Fans, but Engagement is Key to NFO.

Acquisition is only valuable if you engage new fans.

- New fans vs. 20 days prior to the sweepstakes: 4,529%
- Total new fans (unique): 2,500
- Total removed fans (unique): 187

### How to Minimize Unsubscribes During Sweepstakes

- Right-set recruiting goals: Fewer “valuable” fans trump more “vanity” fans.
- Stay true to base: Don’t over-communicate sweepstakes in newsfeed.

### If You See a Spike in Unsubscribes:

- Stop whatever you are doing.
- Review your content.
- Is it relevant?
- Is it interesting?
- Is it social acceptable?
- Adjust the volume: 1 or 2 posts/day is plenty.

### Know Facebook’s “Golden Ratio”

- Overall Facebook average: 27% comments, 73% likes.
- B2B average: 23% comments, 77% likes.
- B2C average: 28% comments, 72% likes.

### Don’t Forget About Weekends

No updates on weekends = missed engagement opportunity.

### The Richer the Media, the Deeper the Engagement

- Links: 37%
- Photos: 40%
- Videos: 45%

(Percentages represent engagement rates.)

### Engagement Drives Visibility

These things hurt:

- Infrequent posts
- Inconsistent posts
- Declarative posts
- Repetitive topics
- No call to action

These things help:

- 1-2 posts per day
- Consistent timing
- Interrogative posts
- Varied topics
- Asking for response (“Like” if you…)

### Bonus Do: Cute helps. Bonus Don’t: Auto-posting tools.

- Facebook algorithm doesn’t look favorably on auto-posting and 3rd party publisher tools.
- When a publisher tool was used, the content had 61% less visibility than manual posts.

### Shift from Measuring Page Views…

- Less than 1% of fans ever returned to Eloqua’s page, stream views trump page views.
- The average page only reaches 7.5% of its fans. With NFO, Eloqua passed 22%.

### …to Stream Views

- Raw stream views: Every time your status update is rendered in the newsfeed.
- Unique stream views: Number of individuals who see your status updates.
- NFO = Newsfeed Optimization.

### Don’t Forget About Inbound Traffic

What’s 150%? The lift in traffic referred from Facebook to Eloqua’s website and blog during the BrandGlue collaboration.

### Recap: 10 Lessons

- End bad habits
