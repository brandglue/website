### Here’s what they wanted:

1. Visibility: Maximize reach and visibility on Facebook.
2. Traffic: Drive traffic to GOOD’s website to generate more revenue.

### Here was the plan:

For GOOD Inc., we aggressively tested the three variables of EdgeRank to ﬁnd the optimal strategy to reach our goals. This included testing diﬀerent types of updates, the copy that was used, the questions that were asked and the length of the copy.

We tested diﬀerent types of photos and graphics. We broke down the audience by geographical location and used this to optimize the timing of the posts.

The 3 components of EdgeRank are:

1. EdgeScore: This is a hard value score determined by the kind of content you post in a status update, such as a photo, video, or link.
2. Affinity Score: This is the relationship between the user and the fan page. The stronger the relationship, the higher the affinity score. The higher the affinity score, the more likely the user is to see a content from the fan page.
3. Time Decay: This is defined by what time of day you post. It also determines how long a status update will last in the news feed.

### Here’s how it went:

1. Visibility: Increased daily organic reach from 18,000 to 70,000.
2. Traffic: Increased traffic to the website from social by 31%.
3. Engagement: Increased engaged users by 178%.
4. Growth: Grew from 120,000 fans to 280,000 fans with solely organic growth strategies.
5. Reach: Reached 28% of GOOD’s fan base (18% higher than the average fan page).
