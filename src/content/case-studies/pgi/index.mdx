### Here’s what they wanted:

1. Visibility: Increase awareness and visibility of PGi’s booth at an upcoming event.
2. Engagement/traffic: Schedule onsite meetings at the event and boost booth traffic during the event.

### Here was the plan:

Leading up to Enterprise Connect 2019, we crafted a plan combining organic and paid social efforts to increase awareness of PGi’s booth/presence at the event as well as drive requests for one-on-one onsite meetings. Organically, we posted consistently for the ~6 weeks leading up to the event, driving web/social traffic to a specific landing page created by PGi for the event (which included a form to sign up for an onsite meeting); social posts tested a variety of messaging, graphics and gifs. Each post also included the event hashtag as well as PGi’s booth information.

Paid ads support our organic efforts by specifically targeting the following audiences in the ~4 weeks leading up to the event:

- Past Enterprise Connect attendees (2017-2018)
- Registered attendees for the 2019 event
- Industry analysts
- People who had searched online for “Enterprise Connect”
- People who had visited PGi’s website in the past 365 days

In addition, we also targeted people currently in the geographic area of the event (Orlando) during the week of the conference.

Like with our organic efforts, our paid ads also tested a variety of messaging, graphics and gifs; each ad included the event hashtag as well as PGi’s booth information and drove traffic to the event-specific landing page to sign up for an onsite meeting.

### Here’s how it went:

1. Visibility: Organic and paid social efforts garnered over 250,000 post impressions and more than 550 clicks to the event-specific landing page.
2. Engagement/traffic: The PGi booth saw heavy foot traffic throughout the duration of the event, driving high lead generation for the events team. In addition, social ads drove a high volume of one-on-one onsite meetings.
