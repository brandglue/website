### The Task

Move Free is a leading national joint supplement.

Our Tasks:

1. Grow the Move Free Facebook page from zero to 50,000 fans with folks who fit their target demographic.
2. Build an engaged audience who interacts regularly with their content.

### Growth: Initial Investment

We needed to build a beginning base of fans that fit our targeted demographic of consumers age 55+. The first 5,000 fans were obtained through Facebook advertising.

### Content Strategy: Pillars

1. Education
2. Regimen
3. Empowerment
4. Current Events

We created these content pillars to show how Move Free solves the pain points of their customers and gives them lifestyle benefits. They provided us with a content roadmap, enabling us to create a consistent stream of messaging for our audience around these topics.

### Content Strategy: Graphics

We wanted our fans to recognize our content in their news feeds, so we branded our content and made it easily recognizable. To help foster engagement, we created mini-infographics that were interactive and educational.

### Growth: Provide fans with product samples

After obtaining our initial 5,000 fans and putting our content strategy into place, it was time to escalate our growth. We utilized a sampling program that had three objectives:

1. Get a sample of our product into the hands of users.
2. Gather data and email addresses to be used for email marketing.
3. Grow our Facebook page with our targeted demographic.

To make the sampling program a huge success, we recommended that Move Free partner with a well known brand. We were able to work with the Dr. Oz Show for our first program, as the audience fit our target demographic.

Dr. Oz’s website directed his audience to our Facebook sampling app, which was located on the Move Free Facebook page. We gained 11,000 new fans our first day and an additional 30,000 fans over the following month.

### Growth: Sampling programs and engagement

We ran two more sampling programs through the end of the year that featured new products. We grew our fan base to 87,000, a 1,600% increase that greatly exceeded our initial goal of 50,000 fans.

Move Free was able to capture email addresses from the sampling programs and build out their email marketing campaigns. Emails were sent to see if users wanted to purchase a full supply of the product. They were also sent information about new product releases and given discounts and coupons to incentivize further purchases.

### Content Strategy: Engagement

Throughout the year, we constantly examined our engagement data and compared it with our content pillars. We tagged each of our Facebook posts with the appropriate content pillar, allowing us to continually adapt future content and make sure we were maximizing our reach and engagement. Our monthly engaged user rating, which is the number of unique individuals engaging with our content, climbed as high as 66,000. 78% of our Facebook fans were engaging with us.

### Zero to 85k: The results

- 75 million impressions on Facebook
- 25% of traffic to Move Free’s website came from Facebook
- 85,000 new fans
- 66,000 engaged users
