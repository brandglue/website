If you’re bright, talented, and wish your job really made use of your skills and expertise, you might be just the person we’re looking for.

**We are BrandGlue—a social media strategy and creative agency, reaching our client’s audiences effectively in the places they hang out most.**

We’ve got some exciting new clients and projects in the works as we approach the end of 2020 and head into 2021. So many, in fact, that we need an extra team member to help get everything done, while making sure our new and existing clients are also taken care of.

As the Senior Social Media Strategist, you will be responsible for helping to create and execute the social strategy for our clients. This includes playing a role in creating the social strategy, drafting, scheduling and posting social content for clients following each of their schedules/cadences (including owned/client content and finding curated content), pulling social metrics for client reporting, and handling many other backend operations, such as (but not limited to): scheduling blogs, drafting campaigns and reporting documents, and more. You will also front-face with our clients, with the goal of eventually becoming the main POC for clients.

**When it comes to you, here’s what we want to know:**

* Are you ‘Type A’, extremely organized and efficient, and proud of it?
* Do you love exploring and learning new platforms and programs, as long as they work?
* Do you enjoy laying out a plan and strategy, whether for an upcoming personal trip or for work at your job?
* Are you a competent personality wrangler? In other words, do you get along well with others (even difficult people) while remaining efficient in getting things done?
* Are you the person that friends go to for help?
* Do you love watching from the backstage, knowing that the show was able to go on because of all your behind-the-scenes work?
* Do you have a can-do, “I’ll do anything for my team” attitude? Are you a positive person, consistently known day in and day out for having a great attitude at work?

**We’re looking for a Senior Social Media Strategist to serve on our team as part of our control center for the exciting expansion happening within our agency.**

This is a full-time, remote position. An honest-to-goodness, full-time opportunity that, it just so happens, you can do from anywhere within the continental U.S.A.

We don’t need you to know every aspect of digital marketing, but you do need to know the general lay of the digital marketing land, and consider yourself knowledgeable (if not an expert) in social media. This includes:

* Being a daily (at the very least, multiple times a week) social media user on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest (Snapchat is a plus).
* Familiarity with premium online content, such as webinars, ebooks, whitepapers, etc.
* Knowledge and execution experience of social advertising and key metrics like impressions, engagement, CTRs, CPCs, CPLs.
* Experience with campaigns, marketing personas, social reporting, and managing multi-tiered social ad campaigns.

We’ll be straight with you: This position has high expectations. But if you’re the person we’re looking for, you’re the type who gets motivated by high expectations.
