As the world of digital marketing continues to evolve, there’s one thing that is always consistent -- the measurement of success of one's efforts. Whether you are running a campaign or just evaluating your content strategy on a specific platform, it’s always important to analyze the results.

For today’s data analysis, we’re going to dive into one platform that’s evolved over the years from being just another job/HR site and into a powerhouse of a platform for B2B businesses. Yep, you guessed it -- [Linkedin](https://brandglue.com/blog/is-linkedin-the-new-facebook/). With over 722 million business professionals on the platform, there is a vast ocean of digital opportunities that are present for a brand to be able to connect with their ideal target buyers and audiences.

Whether you’re promoting awareness of your brand story or trying to highlight the services you offer in your respective industry, it's essential to be able to measure your progress. Let's take a look at 3 metrics you should start tracking in order to see how effective your marketing efforts are on LinkedIn.

## Brand Mentions

So you’re familiar with LinkedIn and you are starting to take a closer look at the results of your efforts. One key metric that you should be paying attention to as a business is the brand mentions metric.

Brand mentions involve other users or businesses tagging your brand in posts. This could be an employee that works at your company and is proud of what they have accomplished, or a news article sharing a piece of content that’s noteworthy about your business. One way of viewing brand mentions is that as soon as someone tags your brand, you already know you have impacted that individual in some way. Content being shared about you by others is one of the most important ways of being able to spread your [digital footprint](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-analytics/)in the world of LinkedIn.

Now there may be times that the brand mentions are of a negative nature. However, that’s part of the bigger picture of maintaining a brand and being able to understand the feedback you receive from your audiences, utilizing your social listening skills, and maintaining your brand presence as a whole.

## Engagement

Now onto the second metric that you should add to your tracking list, which is [engagement](https://brandglue.com/blog/are-you-tracking-these-3-important-social-media-insights-for-your-business/). If you’re familiar with any social media platforms, then you already know that engagement is a KPI that is highly important in the digital world. On LinkedIn, this is also true, as the overall big picture is to foster conversations and build a community around your brand.

When tracking the engagement of your LinkedIn posts, it's important to track reactions, shares, and comments separately from one another. Why? Because this will allow you to see which topics or content pieces are resonating best with your target audiences. In order to hit the big picture of fostering a community, it's vital to place an emphasis on the engagement rate and learn from the content you create. This allows you to see how you can adjust your strategies and realign focus on creating content that works with your target users.

What’s nice about the way LinkedIn reports on engagements is that you can easily break down the numbers and metrics per post and see exactly how your efforts correlate with the analytics you are viewing.

## Impressions

The last important metric to track on [LinkedIn is impressions](https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-analytics/). Impressions are the number of times each update is visible to members on the platform. Ideally, your target goal should be to constantly increase the impression rate that you have on the content that is posted. Over a period of time, a consistent increase in impressions will allow you to adjust your content strategy accordingly.

How? By doing the below:

* **Determine posting times:** You will be able to see what days certain content performed better and be able to adjust your content calendar to post content at times that resonate the most with your followers.
* **Understand what posts to sponsor:** If you see that your organic posts are performing strongly in certain areas (not just impressions, but engagement and clicks as well) then you can start sponsoring the content to expand to audiences beyond just your followers.
* **Develop new strategies:** When analyzing your impressions, you can see if there is a fluctuation in trends. If there’s a decrease, then you know what needs to be tweaked; alternatively, if there is an increase, then then you can take note of what efforts are working.
