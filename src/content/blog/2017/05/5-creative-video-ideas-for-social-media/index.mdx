We’ve all heard how important video is for social media. We are expecting that
[video will account for 69% of all consumer traffic by 2017][1] and that [social will be the front door][2]to capture that traffic (if you want to nerd out over the data check out the [Cisco research][3]). But is it really worth it to your bottom line to hire a videographer for
your team? What’s the true ROI from video? How can you convince your boss that
it’s worth the money you want to spend on video? The good news is that video
doesn’t have to be expensive and even if you don’t have a video department,
there are things you can do internally to help boost your video presence
online. We’ve pulled together some of our favorite examples of clever videos
online that won’t break your marketing budget.

### 15-Second Interview Video

Interviews can be fun even without the wit and humor that this one has, but
either way, you can create inexpensive, quick videos that are almost
immediately shareable. Since social media moves so fast, this can be
incredibly useful with current events, holidays or company activities. People
appreciate authenticity and “realness” in the companies they follow, so don’t
worry too much about making these polished. Sometimes the imperfections work
in your favor - just be sure your audio is good. Show your human side
and have fun with it!

### Stop-Motion Video

These can be as simple or as elaborate as you want to want them to be. Heck,
you can even use a prop that you probably already have on hand >> post-it
notes. We’ve seen some incredibly creative video that use stop-motion.
Everything from claymation to drawing to images of people. Here are a few of
our favorites:

#### Use Sticky Notes

### Close-Up of an Action Video

This is one place where you can get really creative and tailor the video to
your specific company. Think about something mundane that you could film
around the office to get your message across in a different way. Maybe it’s
drawing a word, like the video below. Or maybe it’s making a timelapse of the
office kitchen, giving your audience a glimpse into the real life of your
company. You can also use slow motion on your phone! Everyday activities can
morph into something beautiful and intriguing:

### How to Video

Another easy idea is to set up recording your screen and create a “how-to” or
“product tour” video with practical tips for your audience. These can be as
simple as 15-seconds or as elaborate as 20-minutes. Often times your audience
needs more hand-holding when it comes to using your product and video is a
quick way to get that hand-holding to a lot of people at once. Here’s an
example of a how-to video on setting up Instagram (which you should probably
do, if you have not already):

### Just Make Them Laugh Video

Lastly, sometimes you don’t really need a reason for the video other than just
to make your audience laugh. I mean, has a day really gone by where you didn’t
watch or share a dumb YouTube video with a coworker or friend? One great
example of an inexpensive way to create humor for your audience >> record
people making a fool of themselves:
