What makes an ad have the power to move someone to action? A great ad is able to go past the surface level of selling a "product" and hit the audience where they feel it most - the heart strings.

More and more companies are realizing the [benefits of having human-centered advertising strategies][1]. We are seeing a strong presence of campaigns that evoke feeling and emotion, but are also careful not to shove their product in your face. They take the subtle approach of developing warm feelings first towards the brand and then make the connection to the products on your own.

The benefits of these types of campaigns have been overwhelming. It results in [higher
engagement, shares, and word of mouth][2].

We pulled some of our favorite ad campaigns that evoke emotion to share with you
as inspiration for your next campaign. Note how each one makes you feel -
especially towards the brand.

### 1. Coca-Cola - Small World Machines - Bringing India & Pakistan Together

This was one of the first examples I can remember seeing where the brand used
their product to hit on people's emotions. They identified an existing
problem and created a solution that they could be tied to.

### 2. Valspar Paint - Color for the Colorblind

Valspar really hit home with this one by focusing on what they do best: color. Naturally, when I watched this for the first time, I teared up.

Another tear-jerker, Gillette took advantage of the father-son relationship and proved that while we exist in a fast-paced technology-based lifestyle, human-to-human interaction still yields the best results.

The [Ad Council][3] successfully launched a viral video and got 58 millions views. How did they do it? They chose a controversial topic and were able to find a common denominator between all races and genders. How could you not fall in love with this organization??

### 5. Dove – Real Beauty Sketches Campaign

Dove did an excellent job taking the focus off of their sales and showcasing
what they stand for as a company. They wanted to make women feel beautiful.
They were able to take common insecurities and debunk them by showing each
woman how their perception of themselves is not what other’s see.

### 6. Always – #LikeAGirl

I'm sure you remember this one. This video quickly went viral, spreading
across the Internet like wildfire. The entire campaign is focused on
empowering women, especially at a young age. What better way to encourage and
support the next generation of girls?

After watching those, I don’t think I need to convince you that video has a
powerful effect on any audience. Add on top of that, that in these examples
the video is connecting to people - real humans - with what they
value and care about in life. These brands are tying themselves to a greater
cause outside of what they are selling. This ideas proves time and time again
to be one of the best ways to build loyalty as a brand.
