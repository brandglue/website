# We’re Hiring A Design Lead

**About BrandGlue**

We are a social media agency, reaching our clients’ audiences in the places they hang out most. The companies we work with would tell you that we pride ourselves on our “Nordstrom-level” customer service and that we know our stuff. Social media best practices change almost daily and we provide the peace-of-mind that we are reaching and growing each client’s audience on social media in the most effective ways possible. 

At BrandGlue, we like to have fun, enjoy the people we work with, and love to see our clients win. We are known for getting work done quickly and efficiently and providing top-level industry knowledge about social media and current trends. We are a fully remote team (and will remain as such forever) based across the continental U.S., from Washington State to Florida.  

**Who We Are Looking For**

BrandGlue is seeking to hire a self-motivated and deadline-driven Design Lead who will both lead and shape the creative process for all client projects. As a small and nimble team, this position plays an integral role in the success of our agency. As such, the person who fills it is expected to be highly motivated and able to work in a fast-paced environment. Working in the fast-paced environment of social media, adhering to deadlines is of the utmost importance. The Design Lead should maintain their skills in design software for both static graphics and video, including Adobe Creative Suite. The person in this role should be familiar with and adept at understanding and implementing a range of Brand & Style Guides, as delivered by our clients.

Because of our unique structure, each team member has autonomy and flexibility with their day-to-day schedule, meaning we expect each of our team members to be self-motivated, driven and trustworthy. Again, meeting and exceeding deadlines is an integral function of this role. As with everyone on the team, we expect the Design Lead to be able to answer chats and calls throughout the work day, keep the rest of the team updated on each project process, and respond to emails promptly during work hours. This role may also directly interact with our clients—many of whom are in the B2B technology space—on a periodic basis.

**When it comes to you, here’s what we want to know:**

* Are you more of a ‘Type A’, extremely organized and efficient, and proud of it?
* Do you enjoy laying out a plan and strategy, whether for an upcoming personal trip or for work at your job?
* Are you a competent personality wrangler? In other words, do you get along well with others (even difficult people) while remaining efficient in getting things done?
* Are you the person that friends go to for help?
* Do you love watching from the backstage, knowing that the show was able to go on because of all your behind-the-scenes design work?
* Do you have a can-do, “I’ll do anything for my team” attitude? Are you a positive person, consistently known day in and day out for having a great attitude at work?
* Are you a designer who also can get into the weeds, effectively having a bird’s-eye view of things while also being able to drill down into the finer details?

**We’re looking for a Design Lead to serve on our team as part of our control center within our agency.**

**Responsibilities** 

The responsibilities of the Design Lead includes managing all creative projects, which primarily consist of social media graphics, infographics, ebook/whitepaper layout & design, and animated videos for clients across a variety of B2B industries. For a list of some of the clients that we have worked with, please visit our website. This role will also be responsible for developing internal marketing pieces for BrandGlue’s website, email marketing, social media channels and other needs that may arise. 

Other skills that are crucial to the success of this position are possessing the ability to interface with clients with poise and professionalism and explain the strategy behind the designs (graphics or videos) we create. Strong communication skills are a must, as well as having a high level of integrity for keeping yourself on schedule for meetings and deadlines. The Design Lead is supported by another team member as the main point-of-contact (POC) for each client, and will work closely with those individuals. This will include guiding the client and BG main POC on design brainstorms, getting approval of concepts, pitching new ideas, and communicating throughout the execution process. New clients, brands and projects are common, giving this role the exciting opportunity to work with a variety of different creative styles. 

**To be honest: This position has high expectations. But if you’re the person we’re looking for, you’re the type who gets motivated by high expectations.**

* You would be the owner and strategist for all graphic and video content for our clients. You will be held responsible for how well things get done for clients.

* You will evaluate design tasks daily to make sure all requests are taken care of. You will prioritize design tasks and special requests from each team member accordingly so they get done on time and in a topnotch, quality manner. 
* You will collaborate with other team members. These colleagues are working on other client needs at the same time, and you will be responsible for managing your requests and collaborating with them to juggle the other work they are doing for the larger team. 
* You will be responsible for making sure internal processes, as well as client-specific processes, are followed and all deadlines are met.
* You will be responsible for reviewing all design work you have completed, making sure it meets all requirements (spelling/grammar check, imagery/video is on-brand, etc.). 
* You will be responsible for keeping your BrandGlue team lead apprised of your various design projects. You will have a lot of autonomy; you just need to check-in regularly so that we know you’re on track and feel adequately supported. 
* You will QA everything, serving as the design check before sending work to a team member or client.
* You will be the main POC for all things design-related. You are responsible for maintaining and succeeding at this role, giving 100% to and for each client and brand.
