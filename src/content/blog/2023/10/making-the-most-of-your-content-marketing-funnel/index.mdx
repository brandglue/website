## Content Marketing Funnels

Imagine this as the wide end of a funnel, where your goal is to cast a broad net to capture the attention of a vast audience. At this stage, your target audience may not even be aware of their specific needs or problems, let alone your brand or product. Your mission is to create awareness and establish your brand as a valuable resource. To capture those potential customers at this stage, focus on educating the reader, providing value, and sparking their interest in your brand.

At this point, you've successfully guided your leads through the awareness-building process (TOFU) and nurtured their interest (MOFU). Now, the spotlight is on conversion and sealing the deal.
