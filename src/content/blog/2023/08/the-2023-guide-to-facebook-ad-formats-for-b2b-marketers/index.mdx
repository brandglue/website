After releasing its guide to Instagram ad formats earlier this year, Meta just dropped a new cheat sheet for [Facebook ad formats](https://www.facebook.com/100064731428807/posts/638683158299393).

From image ads, to engaging videos, to dynamic carousels, this guide takes you through all the diverse range of ad formats available on the platform and how they can benefit both B2C and B2B campaigns.¬†

 Image ads are a great option for marketers to showcase their products, services, or brand visually and include a compelling caption and call-to-action (CTA). Meta recommends using image ads to:

* Show off products
* Announce promos or sales
* Increase brand awareness

Best sizes for image ads are 4:5 aspect ratio for feed image ads, and 9:16 aspect ratio for story image ads.¬†







#### Videos

Video ads are a great option for marketers to offer a powerful medium to tell their brand story, demonstrate product features, share customer testimonials, or provide educational content. Meta recommends using video ads to:¬†

* Introduce your brand
* Highlight a service
* Show off your products‚Äô unique features

Meta also recommends shooting in 9:16 aspect ratio for video ads so they fit into reels and story posts.¬†

#### Carousels

Carousel ads allow marketers to showcase multiple images or videos within a single ad unit. This format is effective for highlighting various products, telling a sequential story, showcasing different features, or presenting a step-by-step process. Meta recommends using carousel ads to:¬†

* Increase conversion rates
* Feature up to 10 images and videos in a single ad with ¬† individual links¬†

Meta recommends enhancing carousels with optimizations using Ads Manager.



#### Instant Experience

Instant Experience ads provide an immersive, full-screen mobile experience. These can include images, videos, carousels, and other interactive elements to create a captivating brand experience within the Facebook platform. Meta recommends using this format to:

* Highlight multiple products and/or services
* Increase engagement with an interactive ad

Meta recommends using their pre-selected templates to create an optimized Instant Experience.



#### Collections¬†

Collection ads feature a primary image or video along with several related product images that sit further below. When users click on the ad, it opens up an immersive, full-screen experience that showcases a range of products. Meta recommends using this format to:

* Promote an entire catalog in one ad
* Encourage multiple purchases
* Increase sales on mobile devices¬†

Meta recommends using a 1:1 aspect ratio for feed placements of collection ads.
