Have you noticed an abundance of videos in your Facebook news feed?

Changes to Facebook’s news feed algorithm last month was designed to provide users with better videos on the platform. The tweak includes a new video ranking system which takes into account whether people are actually watching each video — and for how long — before deciding who else will see that video in their feed. This new metric is designed to determine how captivating the content is and is a better indicator than opposed to likes and comments. Users who routinely hit the play button can expect to see more of the same.

"People who tend to watch more video in News Feed should expect to see more videos near the top of their Feed," Facebook wrote in a [blog post][1]. "Conversely, people who tend to skip over videos without watching them should expect to see fewer videos."

The change was made with both users and advertisers in mind. Aside from continuing to provide users with more of the content that they are most interested in, Facebook is working on including more video advertisements. This step is to help identify those who would be most interested in video content; moving forward, they will begin to see more video ads instead of image-based ads.

With the new focus on video content, will you begin to put more of a focus on it in your content and advertising strategy?
