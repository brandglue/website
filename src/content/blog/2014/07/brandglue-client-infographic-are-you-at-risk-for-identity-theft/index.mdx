Did you know that 14% of Americans have been the victim of identity theft? Whether from stolen credit cards, bank accounts or personal information, cleaning up the mess with the banks will take hours, not to mention wreaks havoc on your credit score. The easiest way to deal with identity theft is prevention. Check your credit report regularly and monitor your bank accounts and credit cards for suspicious charges. Also, shred documents with your personal information and change your account passwords frequently (and remember to also have different passwords for each account!)

Want to go a step further? Sign up for Credit Sesame’s identity protection. The best part? It’s _free_.
