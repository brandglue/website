Whether you want to share industry tips and tricks, or update your customers on the latest news at your company, maintaining a blog can be a great piece in your content marketing strategy. In order to get more eyes on your content, make use of your built-in audience on Facebook.

[These five tips from Socially Stacked][1] to use Facebook status updates to drive traffic to your blog are just the trick.

### 1. Enable Facebook’s Comment plug-in on your blog.

This has a 2-in-1 purpose. Not only does the plug-in help limit the number of spam comments, it also shares your post on your readers’ newsfeed each time they comment.

### 2. Use a choice quote from a post as a status update.

Entice your readers with a small snack and then lead them to your blog where they can enjoy the whole meal. Choosing one sentence from a post that will motivate your readers to click through to learn more.

### 3. Link your blog in the “About” section of your Facebook Page.

Yes, this sounds like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised about how few people only include a link to their homepage and miss out on the opportunity to drive traffic to their blog.

### 4. Repeat links to recent blog posts.

Since only a small percentage of your fans see your status updates on a regular basis, don’t be shy about linking more than once. This tip is especially helpful if your readers live in multiple time zones. In addition to posting a couple of times in one day, re-share old content to reach a new audience.

### 5. Advertise.

While you may not wish to pay to drive fans to your blog, it is the easiest way to reach the right audience. Facebook’s Demographics Targeting and Interest Targeting options, for example, allow you to select exactly whom you want to see that ad.

There you have it. **With a few extra steps, your blog readership will be up in no time. Are there any other tactics you’ve found effective?**
