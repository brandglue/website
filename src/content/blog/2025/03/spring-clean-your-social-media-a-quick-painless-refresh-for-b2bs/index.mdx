*Spring is the perfect time to refresh your social media channels. BrandGlue’s guide walks you through easy steps to optimize profiles, paid campaigns, and boost engagement for a stronger online presence.*

Spring is in the air, which means it’s the perfect time to dust off your social channels and refresh them. For B2B brands, social media efforts are often a mix of organic engagement and paid advertising, and keeping both in tip top shape is essential for driving results. Here’s a simple, no-stress guide for spring cleaning your socials.

### Audit Your Profiles (Yes, All of Them)

Start with a full sweep of your social media accounts. Check for outdated bios, broken links, and inconsistent branding. Your LinkedIn, X, Facebook, and Instagram accounts should all reflect your current messaging, product offerings, and visual identity.

Quick Fix: Update your profile images, cover photos, and company bios to keep everything fresh and aligned with your brand’s latest look and feel.

### Refresh Your Content Strategy

Content that performed well six months ago might not be resonating today. Look into your analytics and pinpoint what’s working and what’s not. Are your engagement rates dipping? Are certain content formats (like carousels or short videos) getting more traction than others?

Quick Fix: Adjust your content mix to emphasize high-performing formats. If text-heavy posts aren’t getting much engagement, lean into shorter copy, better visuals, customer stories, or quick thought leadership takes.

### Fine-Tune Your Paid Campaigns

If you’re running paid social ads, now’s the time to check in on performance. No, not just single ad performance. I’m talking overall campaign structure and results. Are your audiences still relevant? Are your CTAs driving conversions? Old campaigns can drain budget without delivering results.

Quick Fix: Pause underperforming ad sets, refresh creatives, and test new audience segments to optimize spend.

### Optimize for Engagement, Not Just Reach

B2B social media isn’t just about getting in front of the right people, it’s about starting conversations. Are you responding to comments? Are employees engaging with your content? Are you getting shares? Encourage more participation by tagging partners, asking questions, and sharing insights that start a discussion.

Quick Fix: Schedule time each week to engage with your audience directly. Here’s what I mean: comment on relevant industry posts, reply back to comments on your brand page (and use the person’s first name to build rapport, if you can!) reply to DMs, or create polls. 

### Update Your CTAs

If all of your social media posts are still saying “Learn More” or “Visit Our Website,” it’s time for a refresh. A solid CTA should drive specific actions, like downloading a resource, signing up for a webinar, or booking a demo. If you have to think deeply about what your CTA should be, then, you probably don’t need one. Let your audience watch your video, interact, or share. Some content can just *be*.

Quick Fix: A/B test different CTAs on organic posts and paid ads to see which drives the most engagement. 

### Align Social with Business Goals

Social media isn’t just a big megaphone, it should support your larger marketing objectives. Whether that’s brand awareness or lead generation,  ensure your social strategy aligns with what your business is prioritizing this quarter.

Quick Fix: Meet with your sales and marketing teams to align on key initiatives and adjust your social content to support them.
