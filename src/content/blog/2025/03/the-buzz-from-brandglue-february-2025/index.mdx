First launched in 2023, Predictive Audiences gave advertisers the ability to expand the pool of target customers based on LinkedIn’s AI that identifies patterns, behaviors, and similar characteristics. Since replacing Lookalikes, Predictive Audiences always used contact lists as their data source. LinkedIn recently announced that it is expanding this to include company lists as well. This update is extremely valuable for B2B marketers since we can now enable exclusions and expand business targeting based on their insights.

After working on this highly-anticipated integration for over a year, more ad account managers are being invited to link their Google Analytics data into Meta’s system. The goal is to allow Meta and Google to work together to establish more context on web traffic, which, combined with the pixel and Conversions API should help provide more understanding of the key performance drivers for campaigns. In our team’s opinion, this is a no-brainer if you use Google Analytics because it gives deeper insights into traffic which gives Meta’s AI tools more context and resources to train its performance over time.

Now we can finally know whether those “comment for better reach” comments make a difference. Recently, LinkedIn began showing the impressions that your comments have received. Counted each time someone views your comment, page admins will be able to see the impression count of all comments made as a page. One interesting caveat is your own view will be counted towards the impression count.

### \> [Standalone Reels App Coming?](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-may-launch-reels-as-separate-app-increasing-pressure-on-tiktok)

As the battle against TikTok continues, Instagram is reportedly considering launching a separate Reels app. The standalone app would essentially be a direct replica of TikTok and open to a full-screen, scrolling display of videos. With Reels now able to be up to three minutes long, these longer videos are key to making this strategy work. If there is more (and longer) content in a dedicated Reels app, it could keep users engaged longer, but would certainly take away from Instagram’s engagement and time spent in-app numbers.

### \> [New Automated Ad Options Added to X](https://x.com/xbusiness/status/1893047658958463094?s=46&t=LVz949MUpg6ooL1P5S9R4A)

Combined with a new update to Grok, X is now allowing advertisers to generate creative, targeting, and analytics with minimal input from the user. Prefill with Grok only requires the website URL, and then Grok generates the ad copy, imagery, and CTA headline tailored to your brand. You do have the ability to tweak it, but this is essentially automating the entire ad creation process. While this does allow you to activate a campaign in a couple of minutes, your landing page better be tested since that is what everything is based on.

### \> [Interests Feature Being Tested on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@faslu_35/post/DG29lz5BwGk)

Threads looks to be introducing a new feature that allows users to add interests to their profiles. This addition provides the option of adding topics that you’re passionate about and makes it easier for users to showcase what is important to them. This will likely lead to users being able to search for others based on interests, which will make it easier to find folks that you want to engage with.
