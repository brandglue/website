LinkedIn is working hard to build accurate, data-driven attribution that improves campaign performance and ROI. They’ve been focused on Multi-Touch Attribution and Marketing Mix Modeling that they say has been successfully deployed for LinkedIn’s internal marketing, and are planning to leverage this for all advertisers. According to their blog post, they state that this hybrid approach has delivered comprehensive funnel insights and will continue to research and implement improvements as they are utilized. This is a highly technical, but very good read for anyone advertising on LinkedIn.

What are the key factors that power Instagram’s algorithm? What do you need to understand in order to maximize your reach? According to Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram,the three biggest factors are watch time, likes, and sends. If you’re looking to grow your reach, pay particular attention to average watch time, and likes and sends per reach. Mosseri states that the importance of each varies based on whether it is connected or unconnected content.

The full-screen, vertical video display format that we’ve seen on LinkedIn’s mobile app is now coming to desktop. The “Videos for You” module allows desktop users to swipe or click through to discover more content, giving brands another way to maximize exposure for their video assets.

More AI innovations and recommendations are coming to Meta’s advertising platform. The biggest ones of relevance are Advantage+ leads campaigns and expanding opportunity score. Our team plans to monitor the feedback to the Advantage+ leads campaigns as these automated setups typically result in extremely broad targeting with no way to quantify “quality lead” other than Meta’s word. Opportunity score is exciting because it may give us new ways of optimizing a campaign based on Meta’s algorithmic feedback.

### \> [Dedicated Video Tab Launched on X in the U.S.](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/x-formerly-twitter-adds-dedicated-video-tab-US/737884/)

After testing for over a year, the new video tab for X is here for U.S. users. Located at the bottom function bar of the app, it is designed to give quick access to the platform’s full-screen immersive video feed. Like other platforms, X is calling itself video first, which makes sense given views in the app have increased 40% year-over-year.

Threads has added a few new updates that users have been asking for. You are now able to schedule posts on Threads, as well as markup ones that you’re resharing. This gives users the ability to add a creative take. It is currently only available in a few countries and has received mixed reviews, but it will be interesting to see if Threads doubles down on this. At the very least, being able to schedule posts is a huge win for users.

**That’s a wrap on the updates!**
