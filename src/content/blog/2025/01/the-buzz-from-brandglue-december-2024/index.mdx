You may have noticed some larger videos being shown in your LinkedIn feed recently. This new format includes rounded corners on the display in an effort to make the video clips stand out even more in-stream. While past ideas like LinkedIn Stories were quickly scrapped, the platform’s immersive TikTok-like video feed has seen a 36% usage growth in 2024. This current format is being tested with selected iOS users at the moment, but it likely won’t be long before it’s rolled out to a larger audience.

The cover image on your LinkedIn profile has always been a great way for users to visually express their personality, interests, business, or brand. Now, in an update that can be a big benefit to executives with a presence on LinkedIn who are Premium Business subscribers, these members can now select up to five photos to create a rotating slideshow.

Social media moves really fast and it can be hard to keep track of all of the latest updates and new features. Meta advertising is certainly no exception to that. Jon Loomer put together an end-of-year walkthrough that highlights major changes like:

* Addition of Audience Segments
* Scaling high performing ads without re-entering the learning phase
* Expanded images and video

It appears that Meta may be considering an option that would enable brands to pay for views, likes, or other engagement in the Instagram app. Select users are currently getting surveys from Meta in the app that presents them various scenarios including ones that seem to indicate a follower growth option. This is a little odd since Meta’s current Community Standards forbid buying followers, but it could just be an expansion of Meta’s Verified program.

### \> [X Algorithm Update to Focus on Entertaining Content](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/x-formerly-twitter-flags-algorithm-update-entertainment/736502/)

In an effort to cut down on the platform’s negativity, an algorithm update is coming which claims to put more focus on “informational/entertaining” content. While Meta has taken queues from X when it comes to subscriptions and content moderation, this shift sounds similar to the changes Meta made recently to reduce the reach of political content in response to user feedback.
