Does your brand tell a story via social media? If not, it should.

Stories are a universally understood means of communication and have been
around in various forms for millennia. And they’re powerful because they dig
down into the emotional part of our psyche. When it comes to convincing people
to listen to you or buy your product, emotions are the key that will unlock
your audience’s actions.

If you think storytelling should be left to the Hollywood elites and PR
experts, think again. You have a product or service to offer, and a
fundamental part of marketing is communicating that offer to potential
customers, particularly on social media platforms. Using the framework of
story is an excellent way to accomplish that goal.

It need not be complicated or unattainable. The trick is knowing how to tell a
story that will resonate with your target audience. Below are three tips for
crafting a powerful story on social media that will communicate the value of
your brand in a meaningful, authentic, relatable way.

### Make Your Story About Your Customer

On the surface, this may seem counterintuitive. You’re telling the story of
how amazing your product is, right? Not so fast. Sure, your product may be the
most jaw-dropping invention your audience has come across in years, but do
they care?

Not really—at least, not in the way you might think. In reality, what they
care about is how your product will improve their lives.

Will it streamline workplace communication?

Will it solve a pressing physical problem?

Will it equip them to succeed in life?

In his book, [_Building a StoryBrand_][1], Donald Miller explains that **when
creating a story for your brand, the customer—not you or the company or
product—needs to be the hero.**

In a good story, the hero always wants or needs something. Enter the customer.
Your goal, when conveying information about your brand, is to cast off the
cloak of hero and don the cloak of guide. The hero needs a specific thing to
solve a specific problem, so your goal is to position your brand as the guide
to give them what they need. Gandalf leading Frodo toward Mordor, so to speak.

Miller writes, “If we aren’t answering customers’ questions, they’ll move on
to another brand. If we haven’t identified what our customer wants, what
problem we are helping them solve, and what life will look like after they
engage our products and services…we can forget about thriving in the
marketplace.”[^1]

There’s a saying in writing that every character thinks he or she is the hero
of the story. Same with people. We all identify as the hero. When
communicating to your customers on social media, keep that in mind and rather
than turning them off by placing your brand front and center, present them as
the hero to whom you have value to offer.

### Make Sure Your Story Rings with Authenticity

When it comes to marketing, millennials crave authenticity. In fact, according
to a survey by Social Media today, [90% of millennials rank authenticity][2] as an important factor in deciding which brands to support.

Not only that, but brands that try to fake authenticity have a rough go. The
survey revealed that content perceived to be inauthentic on social media was
enough to cause 30% of millennials (and 20% of consumers overall) to unfollow
a brand. And since millennials are the [buyers and decision-makers][3] of the future, brands need to get in tune with what resonates with them.

Leave behind the too-good-to-be-true assurances and unrealistic messaging, and
instead focus on being real.

### Make Your Story Easy to Understand

Now that you have a customer-centric story filled with authenticity rather
than pie-in-the-sky promises, it’s time to get that message out. The key here
is making it easy to understand.

Not to you, to your audience

As marketers, we suffer from the [curse of knowledge][4]. We know the details of the products we’re marketing as well as we know our dog’s name. The danger comes in assuming your potential customers do as well

Miller again: “The narrative coming out of a company…must be clear….[^2]
When having to process too much seemingly random information, people begin to
ignore the source of that useless information in an effort to conserve
calories. In other words, there’s a survival mechanism within our customers’
brain that is designed to tune us out should we ever start confusing them.”[^3]

So when writing copy, whether for your website, an email marketing campaign,
or social media posts, ask yourself, “Will potential customers understand
this?” If not, consider brainstorming ways to distill your message down to its
essence. The less mental work you give people to do, the more likely they are
to stick around and hear what you have to say.

When branding your company, tell a story about how you can help the
customer—the hero—overcome their problem, and do so in a way that’s authentic
and clear. With that framework in mind, you’ll be well on your way to building
a brand that stands out and attracts your ideal customers.
