It’s no easy task for businesses and marketers to reach customers organically
on social media, especially when the algorithms of social platforms are
forever changing. With more and more algorithm refinements happening every
single day, you have to either learn to work with the systems, or watch your
social metrics and traffic steadily decline.

So, how can you ensure that you get the best results? Here are six tips on how
you can work with social platform algorithms to maximize your performance.

### Tip #1: Upload video content directly

Video content is an extremely powerful way to organically reach people on
social media. It’s also the current type of post that most favorably plays to
each social platforms’ algorithm.

[Natively posted video content][1] receives 10x more shares than Youtube or other third party sources. Make sure that your videos include captions so that the audience can understand your content even without the sound

If producing long, elaborate videos doesn’t fit your schedule or budget, try
posting micro-videos. It only takes a matter of minutes to shoot, edit and
post these short clips.

### Tip #2: Broadcast live

Posting videos natively is a great start towards earning more social media
engagements, but you can take that success even further by utilizing live
social media broadcasts. These can allow you to show off the more personal
side of your brand by sharing behind-the-scenes content or real-time customer
testimonials and events.

Avoid short live streams. People need time to tune into your stream while it
is still active. Your followers will spend [3x more time][2] watching your video while it is live than they will after the fact.

### Tip #3: Use GIFs and memes

GIFs are an awesome way to more adequately express emotions and experiences on
your social media platforms.This makes them highly shareable and, potentially
best of all, can require no effort on your part if you choose to use ones that
have been created elsewhere.

Facebook and Twitter have already included GIF keyboards that allow you to
simply choose your favorite when it’s time to post. If the overachiever in you
isn’t satisfied with the options, you can always build your own GIF and
include branded content.

Take your GIFs to the next level by adding text and turning them into a meme.
Like GIFs, they are very shareable and can help your brand produce viral
content.

Keep in mind that LinkedIn does not currently support GIFs, so you’ll have to
stick with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the time being. Each of these
platforms via GIF as a short video, so you will get the current algorithm
benefits of a video post.

### Tip #4: Utilize UGC

When users create (positive) content about your brand, take the opportunity to
highlight, retweet and repost it.

User-generated content puts the customer front and center. It lets
your customers take note of how people use your products and share their
passion for the brand.

When consumers scroll through their social media channels, they are looking
for new and interesting content that captures their attention. If your content
captures their attention, they are far more likely to engage with it. The
problem is customers have grown tired of overly branded content, so they are
less likely to respond to it. However, using user-generated content provides
an [authenticity][3] that consumers like to interact with. Plus, this engagement will tell the algorithm that these type of posts are doing well, and will show these posts to even more fans and followers

### Tip #5: Respond to customers

If you’re expecting your audience to engage with your posts, know that your
fans and followers have the same expectation in return. It’s great to like and
repost user generated-content to let your followers know that you are paying
attention to them and appreciate them. But, your engagement shouldn’t stop
there.

When questions are asked, or comments are made, it’s important to take the
time to respond. Some comments simply require a “like,” while others require a
written response. No question should ever be left unanswered. Typically, you
have [24 hours to respond][4] to a question or comment. You can accomplish this by setting aside a few minutes on your calendar each day to check through your notifications.

A word of caution: generic copy and paste responses are easily spotted and can
take away from your authenticity. Take the time to tailor your responses. You
also don’t want to get the dreaded unfollow or spam report, as the algorithms
on each social network do not take kindly to this type of feedback.

### Tip #6: Use topical events

If you want your followers to engage with the content you post, it only makes
sense that you should post content they’re interested in.

With just a few simple searches, you can discover trending topics that will
captivate your audience and show your commitment to staying in-the-know.

Holidays are an easy way to add some non-branded content to your social
platforms. From there, you can create content about local activities or
stories that will encourage engagements. All of this engagement, once again,
tells the algorithms of the social networks that you have high quality content
that should be shown to fans and followers.
