algorithms. With the average person watching more than an [hour and a half of video content][1] each day, how can you ensure your video content is successful?

In addition, subtitles, charts and animations allow for easy consumption.

### Instagram

Historically, people associated Instagram with still photography. And, while
photos still make up a major part of Instagram’s content, the outlet is
pushing new ideas. With the launch of Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and

run for their money.

three seconds will determine whether or not the entire video will be consumed,

video content more professional and educational. Avoid posting trivial videos;
you want to add value for your followers.
