Keep in mind that along with posting consistently, you also need to post at
the correct times. Learn when your target audience is most prominent on
Instagram and post most frequently during those times. If they fall outside of
business hours, try using a scheduling tool to help.

get them more involved with your content. In addition, if your followers like
the live video, they are more likely to share (@tag) with their friends or
colleagues.

If the information is specific, you have the ability to choose who will and
will not be notified, as well as who can and cannot view the live story. In
addition, you can control whether or not viewers can comment while the story
is occurring. Remember, once the story is over, the video and all commentary
will be deleted.

behind-the-scenes content or real-time customer testimonials. They are also
great ways to showcase an event.

  created specifically for your brand
- Trending tags - tags that are appearing in the Explore page that are relevant to your brand

photos, GIFs or videos by sharing them on your Instagram account.

more user generated content to be shared in the future.

products for free in exchange for an Instagram post. You can also provide them
with exclusive promo codes and coupons to share. This tactic will lead
customers to your page, helping your number of followers climb.
