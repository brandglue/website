Have you considered using a Facebook Group for your business? While starting
and maintaining a Facebook Group may seem a little intimidating and does
require time and energy each week, there are some big benefits. Facebook
Groups are a great way to add more value to your audience. With the recent
addition by Facebook to allow fan pages to join Facebook Groups, starting and
maintaining a group for your brand is an initiative worth considering. Below
I’ve laid out 4 tactics to help further your business with Facebook Groups.

### Tactic 1: Set the Rules

Facebook has some pre-populated rules for groups, but you’re encouraged to add
your own. Creating group rules helps to keep things in order by setting the
tone for what kind of behavior is expected and tolerated from your members.
The rules can be as strict or as open to interpretation as you would like. The
important thing is to ensure that the rules you set in place play a role in
creating the group experience you aim to provide.

Creating rules for members of the group can also help mitigate any unnecessary
unpleasantness if you ever need to remove someone from the group. The rules
can also protect your business from a legal perspective, so having your legal
team review them is recommended.

### Tactic 2: Post Regularly

As with all things social media, consistency is key.

[Creating a digital marketing campaign][1] and using a management tool can be incredibly helpful in ensuring you are consistent with your posting frequency. Simply enter your group content into your management tool at the same time that you are scheduling organic public posts

For additional convenience, try creating a calendar with weekly themes that
are laid out a few weeks to a month in advance. This layout will provide a
source of base content for you to pull from quickly each week, and help you to
focus on content that will encourage more engagement and conversation within
the group.

### Tactic 3: Respond

In a perfect world, responding to every post and question would be a given.
However, between to-do lists a mile long and limited hours in the day, making
your Facebook Group a priority can be difficult. Leaving questions unanswered
and comments unliked (or responded to) is the fastest way to lose group
members.

Set a specified timeframe (24 hours is standard) goal for when you’ll respond
to questions and comments. The best way to meet this goal is to set aside a
few minutes on your calendar each day at the same time to address any
questions, comments, or concerns you receive. Whatever process you setup, make
sure you don’t use copy and paste generic responses. [Personalize the conversation][2] by tailoring responses to the individual and their comment or question

### Tactic 4: Create Exclusive Content

Who doesn’t want an inside look that the majority of others aren’t able to
get? Exclusivity is a fantastic marketing and sales tactic, and one that plays
very well into the strategy for Facebook Groups.

Creating exclusive content solely for the members of your Facebook group is a
great way to entice the individuals you are most interested in to join, as
well as to keep them engaged.

You can use the group to offer exclusive discounts, private downloads, early
releases and even live sessions. These types of offers and invitations provide
group members with the sense that they are [VIPs][3] and will ultimately make them more likely to remain in the group and engage with your content.

Now that you have 4 tried and true tactics, get started with a Facebook Group
for your brand. And make sure and let us know how it goes.
