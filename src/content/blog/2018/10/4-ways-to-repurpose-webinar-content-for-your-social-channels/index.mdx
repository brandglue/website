Does your company do webinars? If so, you know full well the time, energy and
money that is spent securing panelists, creating assets, promoting the event,
and then—finally—presenting the webinar.

But what happens afterward?

**Your hard work doesn’t have to disappear into the shadows of the internet.** Here are four ways you can utilize webinar content on your social media channels.

### Create a blog series

Depending on the webinar topic, you should easily be able to [create a blog series][1]. Asking an external presenter to compose a guest blog/article will benefit you both. It will allow them to boost their authority on the subject both prior and after the presentation, as well as provide you with additional content.

Another source for the blog series is any internal presenters. They can write
(or help with editing) a blog post for the webinar, one that helps readers
dive further into the content being presented. Another idea would be for them
to create a written version of the webinar.

Once you have your blog series set, be sure and include these blogs into your
social plan for the webinar, both during and after the webinar is presented.
This will help widen the impact of all of your hard work for the webinar.

### Use webinar questions to create polls & start discussions

Typically, a webinar will wrap up by taking questions from the audience. This
presents a great opportunity for you to extend those questions to your social
media audience.

Use questions from the webinar to ask multiple choice questions as a poll on
your Facebook page or Twitter feed. This allows your social audience to have
some fun testing their knowledge and gets them more interested in the webinar
content. After the webinar, say a day or two later, you can provide the
correct answer to the poll - increasing the longevity of your webinar
content and engagement even further.

If quality questions aren’t abundant during your webinar, you can always come
up with a few poll questions of your own.

### Infographic or eBook

A good webinar is filled with all kinds of statistics that can easily become
lost during the presentation. Instead of losing those great tidbits, turn them
into powerful [visual content][2] that increases the lifespan of your webinar.

If you have a larger amount of information that you think your audience would
like to be able to digest, then an eBook or infographic can provide all of the
key points and statistics from the webinar in a digestible, easy to share
format.  As an added perk, you can gather information about your audience
based on the information you receive from the eBook downloads.

### Replay as a Native Facebook Video

[Facebook videos][3] are one of the best ways to earn more engagement on social media, so it’s no surprise that they are also a helpful avenue for ensuring you get the most out of your webinars.

Once your webinar is complete, create a 30 second to 2 minute synopsis, and
upload that directly to Facebook (add on LinkedIn and Twitter for optimal
exposure!). From there, you can boost the video for more views to your desired
target, as well as retarget the individuals who watch a significant portion of
the webinar. This tactic will help you expand your reach and serve up the
content to those who were interested, including those who weren’t able to
attend the webinar.
