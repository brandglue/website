For marketers, [the holidays represent a time to engage fans even more than normal][1]. You can practically push out any status update with the word "Christmas" in it and you'll get more comments and likes than usual.

But wait, is this true?

**I decided to dig into the data from some of BrandGlue's clients and see if the accepted idea that posting over the holidays got higher engagement for these specific fan pages.**

For my study, I looked at 3 fan pages, ranging in size from 130k fans to 5k fans. I took the averages from the entire year for:

- Comments
- Likes
- Impressions
- Overall engagement percentage

**I then looked at the following holidays and compared the averages (for the above data points) from the entire year against the averages for these specific days:**

Thanksgiving, Veteran's Day, Halloween, 4th of July, Father's Day, Memorial Day, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, New Year's Eve and Day, Christmas Eve and Day.

For my study, I only counted holidays that the specific fan page pushed out content that was related to the holiday. If it was non-related, I didn't count the engagement for that day. Please note that for holidays, the majority of push-outs had a "Like this" call-to-action.

The 130k fan page saw a 198% increase in likes, but a -70% decrease in comments for holiday posts.

**Thoughts? Do you get more comments, likes and impressions when you post on holidays?**
